# Fast-FLIM

This repository introduces an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)-based fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) method. Fast training and inference were achieved. This ELM can extract individual fluorescence components from bi-exponential decays. It has a good performance on speed and accuracy.
